# Africa_Economic_Banking_And_Systemic_Crisis
Description

Context

This dataset is a derivative of Reinhart et. al's Global Financial Stability dataset which can be found online at: https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx

The dataset will be valuable to those who seek to understand the dynamics of financial stability within the African context.

Content
The dataset specifically focuses on the Banking, Debt, Financial, Inflation and Systemic Crises that occurred, from 1860 to 2014, in 13 African countries, including: Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Inspiration
My inspiration stems from two questions: "Which factors are most associated with Systemic Crises in Africa?" And; "At which annual rate of inflation does an Inflation Crisis become a practical certainty?"
